### Connect Four Browser Game

The game is connect four, and the objective is to successfully place four chips in a row (either diagonally, across, up, or down).

The technologies I used to build this game are:
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

To play the game, simply click anywhere on the slot you wish to place your chip, and your chip will fall into the lowest available slot. Each chip placed will stack on top of the previous, and so on.
